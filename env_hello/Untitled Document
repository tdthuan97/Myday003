Your mission

Write a function that gets the language of the environment and returns a greeting according to that language.

If the language is French (fr_FR) it returns Bonjour!, otherwise it returns Hello!.

Your function must be named env_hello and in the file named env_hello.py.

def env_hello():
	""" Given no argument this function looks up the LANG environment variable and returns the appropriate greeting

	With a fr_FR language environment variable
	>>> env_hello()
	'Bonjour!'

	In any other case
	>>> env_hello()
	'Hello!'
    """

In Python, the environment is accessible through the dictionary os.environ. This dictionary is available to your program once you have imported the module os. Your solution to the exercice should start like this:
