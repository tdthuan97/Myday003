Your mission

Given a sample sentence, you will create a dictionary that helps predict which words usually come after a given word. This dictionary will hold, for each word as key, a dictionary of words that can come after it and how many times it happened in the sample sentence.

Your function must be named generate_table and in the file named markov.py.

def generate_table(s):
    """
    From a string 's', generate a dictionary where, for a given word, you get
    the words that can come after it and the number of occurrences it happened in the string 's'.

    Example:
    If s == 'i am daniel i am french i like jiu-jitsu', return
    {
        'i': {
            'am': 2,
            'like': 1,
        },
        'am': {
            'daniel': 1,
            'french': 1,
        },
        'daniel': {
            'i': 1,
        },
        'french': {
            'i': 1,
        },
        'like': {
            'jiu-jitsu': 1,
        },
        'jiu-jitsu': {
        }
    }
